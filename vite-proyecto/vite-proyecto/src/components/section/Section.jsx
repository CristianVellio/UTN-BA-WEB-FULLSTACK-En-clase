      <h2>Data on Alola Region</h2>
      <p>
        Alola is made up of four islands: Melemele Island, Akala Island, Ula'ula
        Island, and Poni Island. In the center is an artificial island by the
        name of Aether Paradise. It is a popular resort destination and attracts
        a lot of tourists from other regions. In Alola, humans and Pok√©mon
        coexist in a very close relationship, and a culture has developed that
        is different from other regions.
